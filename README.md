# Terraform Basics

## IDE: 
As a first step we need an IDE to work with the terraform scripts. Any existing IDE should be fine. For example, One can get ATOM editor from https://atom.io/ 

## Terraform Installation: 
1. Download terraform packages based on your OS from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
2. Unzip into a folder. It would have an terraform.exe in it.
3. Goto the machine environment variables and add the path of where terraform.exe resides to the PATH variable

## Verification: 
Goto command prompt and type the following:

terraform --version

The above command should display the version of the terraform.

## AWS CLI

The examples we would be using are all related to AWS. So let's download the AWS CLI to setup the aws profile
